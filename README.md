# Insteon Terminal

This is a fork of pfrommerd's most excellent [Inteon Terminal](https://github.com/pfrommerd/insteon-terminal).  It is currently functionally equivalent to that project.  For details on how to use Insteon Terminal, please visit the README file of that project.

This fork:

* Replaces the ant build file with a gradle build.  All depenencies are now retrieved via gradle.
* Adds unit testing.
